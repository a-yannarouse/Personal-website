       Three ways to excerise during COVID
    </h3>

    <div class="li">
    <p>
     <li> Excerise outside: If you want some fresh air and enjoy the outside again, you can. You can walk or run around your neighborhood and still get excerise. Walking and running outside is a great way to excerise as you are burning calories more and it's easy than during different workouts that you may be uncomfortable with. Everywhere is different with the phases of COVID, however, if you wear a mask around people and stay within 6ft, excersing outside should not be a problem. It is also fun to workout with a friend or a relative and for extra safety as you never know what is going on around you. </li>
    
      <li>Stay at home workouts: You can workout using workout CD, apps and Youtube depending on what part of the body you want to focus on. Workout apps like Fitness Coach, Fitness for Women, and Home Workout - No Equipments are very popular for helping people workout at home without having to go outside. In the unfortunate situation of COVID, doing stay-at-home workouts is the best way and convinent way. Plus they are free. </li>
    
      <li> Dancing: Personally, I love to dance and it is a good way for me to excerise and enjoy what I like to do. I like to dance to K-Pop songs but you can find dance routines and zumba classes on Youtube. Dance is a part of cardio and if you don't want to run or walk but want to excerise, dance is the right choice! </li>
